stack mn peeche lgauya matrix ko yani dimension brha,depth add hogai

in horizontal stack no of col increasees
vertical stack ulta

concatenate with axis 1 is same as horizontal stack while 0 for vstack


axis 0 for rows 1 for col

depth stack is kind of similar to simple stack it takes 2  2d matrix for example of  3 *3 now when we depth stack it it takes both of them flat them and then change axis, best exapmle is in video on 35:00 th


split yani div
isme bhi hsplit se column (mtlb ulat than usual)
and vsplit se row
(div krte hue anne ki direction zehen mn rkho then u wl get it)


m.argmin-> index of min value
0 axis mn hr row k min


cumsum cumproduct -> 1 pichla add or multiply krte jana



fancy indexing
selecting multiple rows for example that r not contiguos


np,maximum(x,y)-> compares and selects max one at each index of matrix



for matrix multiplication
Col of A== Row of B
np.dot(x,y)
